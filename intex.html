            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            Highly motivated technology professional with a diverse background in IT. I started my career working at AT&T, doing various levels of technical support at their call center. I learned many valuable skills, like effective communication and the fundamentals of troubleshooting. I used my experiences from AT&T and associates degrees to obtain my first server administration position with FIS. As the backup administrator, I quickly started to prove my value and motivation to grow with the company. I was quickly promoted to technical consultant and technical lead to help resolve issues within our client networks. My favorite part about these positions was the unrestricted domain administrator access to all services and infrastructure. This created a solid foundation of technical skills, which then opened up an opportunity to join the cyber security services team. On the vulnerability management team, I helped govern and minimize technical risks for our clients. I was promoted to lead security analyst because of my drive and enhancements to the service. This experience has taught me valuable lessons about modern threats, attacks and vulnerabilities. Which is my motivation to learn coding and help develop secure applications from the start. To help build a more secure future and avoid the rat race of cyber attacks.
